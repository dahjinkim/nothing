# **Useful Things from PDS**

As a person who is new to programming, PDS has helped me learn some basic and advanced R skills and gain confidence in working with data. 

Below, I summarize things I found useful.

1. Basic R Operations
    - Learn R syntex

2. Data Cleaning and Visualization
    - ggplot, tidyverse, and dplyr
    - ***super useful*** when working with raw data

3. Basic Statistics
    - Supervised learning
    - Running simple regressions
    
A lot of material can be found in the following link:
